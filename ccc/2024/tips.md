# Mindset

- Write atleast 5-10 testcases before attempting a problem
- Do not settle on the first algorithm that comes to mind
- Think of all edge cases
  - index 0
  - index -1
  - index max
  - index max+1
  - n = 0
  - n = max

# Dynamic Programming

DP problems are typically:

- Optimization Problems (max/min solution)
- Counting Problems (count # of possible solutions)
- "Is it possible?" Problems (determine existence of solution)

## Interval Dynamic Programming

Typically:

- Linear Sequences (arrays/strings)
- Time Complexity (typically O(n^2))
- Pattern Recognition

## Identify Base Cases

The bases cases (simple sub-problems) are often

- Empty Sequences (case where interval is empty)
- Single Element Interval (case where interval is a single element)
